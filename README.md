# Blackjack

This is a version of the classic card game, Blackjack, otherwise known as Twenty-One, Vingt-et-un, or Pontoon.

## How to play

You must first choose how many players are in the game, between 2 and 7, and the names for each of the players. You must then choose how many rounds to play.

During a round, each player will be shown their hand along with the score. They can then choose to receive another card, by pressing 'h', or by sticking with their hand, by pressing any other key.

At the end of each round, the player(s) with the highest score will be declared as the winner(s) of the round. At the end of the game, the player(s) with the most round wins will be declared as the winner(s) of the game.

The game can then be played again, if desired. If multiple games are played then, at the end, the player(s) with the most game wins will be declared as the winner(s) of the tournament.
